This MobileFramework phone application streams live radio from the SomaFM service and can be used to remotely control the somafm-player application. Using KPR DIAL, this example discovers the SomaFM player application running on Kinoma Create and can change channels and the volume level remotely. Channels are selected using a touch-controlled scrolling tuner. A music artist image collage is displayed and updated on track changes. This example demonstrates how to use KPR media to play HTTP streams, build custom UI elements with HTML Canvas, use a proxy handler to fetch data from a web service, and use KPR effects and layers to implement an animated image collage.
