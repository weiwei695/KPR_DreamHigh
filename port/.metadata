	This application demonstrates how to use a KPR Port object to implement a simple toggle switch. Tap the switch to toggle between the on and off states. The toggle state is displayed as text by another KPR Port object. Various KPR port APIs are covered by this example, including drawImage, drawLabel, fillColor and invalidate.
