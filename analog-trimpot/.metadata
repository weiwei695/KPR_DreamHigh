This sample demonstrates how to use an analog trimpot to control the media player volume level. Both device and simulator BLLs are provided. The sample was developed using the Suntan TSR-3386U 10K trimpot available from SparkFun as part number COM-09806. The displayed volume control is implemented using KPR containers and skins.
