	This example demonstrates how to use the projectImage function of the port object.
	The projectImage function allows a 3D projection to be defined in an intuitive way. 
	Imagine holding a sheet of paper in one hand and a camera in the other.
	The paper would correspond to a 2D texture, and what the virtual camera sees is projected onto the port.
	The projectImage function takes 3 parameters: a texture, a billboard description, and a camera description.
	The billboard description includes the size of the texture, 3D position, and 3D orientation.
	The camera description is similar to the billboard, but also includes a field of view.
	Orientations are described as quaternions, which are complex, but the sample includes conversion to and from angles expressed in degrees.
	The sample presents sliders allowing the various billboard (b) and camera (c) parameters to be exercised.
