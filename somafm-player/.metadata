This MobileFramework Kinoma Create example streams live radio from the SomaFM service. Channels are selected using a touch controlled scrolling tuner. A music artist image collage is displayed and updated on track changes. This example demonstrates how to use KPR media to play HTTP streams, build custom UI elements with HTML Canvas, use a proxy handler to fetch data from a web service, and use KPR effects and layers to implement an animated image collage. The SomaFM player also supports KPR DIAL and can be controlled remotely by the somafm-remote phone application.
