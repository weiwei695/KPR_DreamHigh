This project builds on top of the i2c-nfc sample by using the same Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID Controller shield to create an interactive game that makes use of the NFC cards as a "controller". The user places a card on the reader and is able to select an avatar (or “monster”) from about 15 options. The program takes advantage of the fact that data can also be written to a NFC card and uses it as a storage medium: the user’s choice is effectively serialized onto the card as JSON data, and the card can now be brought to another Kinoma Create where the companion project MonsterMayhemGumball is running to proceed with gameplay.
