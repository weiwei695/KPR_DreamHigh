An example that captures from a serial digital camera (VC0706) and displays photographs on the screen when a button (connected to pin 53) is pressed. At startup, the main thread waits for three affirmative Messages back from the camera BLL (one after initialization, one after setting the compression and one after setting the image size). If all goes well, the MainContainer's skin turns green and the user can take a photo by pressing the button.
