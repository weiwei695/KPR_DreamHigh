Sketchat, a contraction of "sketch" and "chat", is a "shared whiteboard" application; when something is drawn on one Sketchat, it appears on all others. The application demonstrates how to discover other Sketchats on the network and how they can easily exchange information.  The pen color can be chosen using a TCS34725 color sensor. An accelerometer is used so that shaking a Create will clear the canvas. When the application is stopped, its drawing dissapears from other Sketchats.
