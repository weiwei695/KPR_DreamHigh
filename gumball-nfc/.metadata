This project is the companion project to MonsterMayhem, and requires a properly programmed NFC card from MonsterMayhem in order to properly work. The user places the preprogrammed card onto the NFC reader and then plays a simple memory game. All the possible candidate “monsters” scroll by, and once the correct avatar is shown (the one initially chosen by the user and programmed onto the card), he/she must quickly remove the card from the reader in order to win the game and receive a gumball. The user is given three tries to do so. If all attempts have been exhausted, then the user must select another monster with a Kinoma Create running MonsterMayhem and reprogram their card.
