	This client app is intended to be run simultaneously with the "device-discovery-server" example and demonstrates how to build a companion app that discovers and interacts with a device. The client discovers all "com.marvell.kinoma.example.discoveryserver" servers on the same network. For each server discovered, the client displays a color swatch in a vertically scrolling container. The color is requested from the server by invoking the server's /color handler. The list is updated on-the-fly as servers are discovered and lost. KPR provides device discovery via built-in SSDP support. This example shows how to discover servers using the built-in SSDP support, create and invoke a cross-application message, and how to dynamically build a scrolling container of items.
