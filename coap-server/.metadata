This server app is intended to be run simultaneously with the "coap-client" example and demonstrates how to implement a CoAP protocol server. The app serves color information and the server name to clients. The server app also changes the color of an attached tri-color LED (Sparkfun 10821) to match the server's info. Since CoAP is a standard protocol, you can use other CoAP clients with the server, such as the Ruby CoAP module. See scripts/test.rb for further information. This example is written using the KinomaJS programming APIs.
