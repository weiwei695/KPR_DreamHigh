		Basic digital clock driven by a periodic update implemented 
		by a pair of handlers. The time handler notifies the application 
		of the time change and then invokes the delay handler to wait 
		1/2 second. Once the delay has completed the time handler is 
		invoked again. The technique is commonly used by applications 
		that require periodic polling of a resource.
