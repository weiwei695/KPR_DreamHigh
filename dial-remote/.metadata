This MobileFramework application demonstrates how to use KPR DIAL to remotely launch, configure and quit the dial-client application installed on Kinoma Create. The dial-client application must be installed on Kinoma Create. KPR DIAL uses SSDP to discover DIAL servers and DIAL requests are issued to the remote DIAL server. The target DIAL application name is the KPR application id. DIAL uses a HTTP POST to launch applications. The body of the request contains the parameters passed to the app.
